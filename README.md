A React renderer for [PlayCanvas](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine) â€“ build interactive 3D applications using React's declarative paradigm.

## Introduction

**@playcanvas/react** is a thin React wrapper around the PlayCanvas 3D engine. It allows developers to create interactive 3D applications and games using React components and hooks, bringing the declarative and component-based architecture of React to PlayCanvas.

By leveraging React's features, you can build complex 3D scenes with reusable components, manage state efficiently, and create interactive experiences with ease.

## Features

- **Declarative 3D Scene Composition**: Construct 3D scenes using JSX, making your code more readable and maintainable.
- **Reusable Components**: Create and compose reusable 3D components, enabling modularity and scalability in your projects.
- **React Hooks Integration**: Use React hooks to manage state and lifecycle events within your 3D components.
- **Event Handling**: Utilize React's event system for user interactions within the 3D environment.
- **Interoperability**: Seamlessly integrate with other React libraries and tools.

## Installation

Install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install @playcanvas/react
```

Ensure that you have the peer dependencies installed:

```bash
npm install react react-dom playcanvas
```

## Getting Started

Here's a simple example to get you started with **@playcanvas/react**.

### Basic Setup

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

import { Application, Entity } from '@playcanvas/react'
import { Camera } from "@playcanvas/react/components"
import { OrbitControls } from "@playcanvas/react/scripts"

function App() {
  return (
    <Application>
        <Entity>
          <Camera/>
          <OrbitControls />
        </Entity>

        <Entity >
          <Render type='box' />
        </Entity>
    </Application>
  );
}

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
```
