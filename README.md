## Why @playcanvas/react?

**@playcanvas/react** is a fully featured 3D library that gives you everything you need to build 3D apps in React ‚Äî without pulling in a maze of external libraries.

It's built around a battle tested 3D engine and ships with powerful built-in features out of the box so you can get up to speed.

## Getting Started

‚ö° Start building in minutes with our [playcanvas-react.app/new](https://playcanvas-react.vercel.app/new) template.

Install with your favorite package manager...

```bash
npm install @playcanvas/react playcanvas
```

You can also clone the following starter template.

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/marklundin/playcanvas-react-template.git
```

### Show me the code

Here's how you render a sphere. 

```jsx
import { Application, Entity } from '@playcanvas/react';
import { Camera, Render } from '@playcanvas/react/components';
import { OrbitControls } from '@playcanvas/react/scripts';

export function AssetViewer() {
  return (
    <Application>
      <Entity position={[0, 2, 0]}>
        <Camera />
        <OrbitControls />
      </Entity>
      <Render type="sphere"/>
    </Application>
  );
};
```

Et voil√†! ‚ú®

## AI assisted editors

To get your IDE up to speed, you can install the latest MDC rules for cursor. Or [grab them here](https://playcanvas-react.vercel.app/rules) to add them manually.

```bash
mkdir -p .cursor/rules && curl -s https://playcanvas-react.vercel.app/rules -o .cursor/rules/playcanvas-react.mdc
```

## Contributing

If you want to build the repo from scratch, check out the following. The monorepo is split into 3 main packages:

- [@playcanvas/react](/packages/lib) - This contains the main react library
- [@playcanvas/blocks](/packages/blocks) - High level React components for common 3D use cases
- [@playcanvas/docs](/packages/docs) - The Documentation site.

If you want to run this entire project locally, including docs just `npm install` and `npm run dev` from the root of the monorepo. This will install and build all the local dependencies and run a local webserver of the docs. 

You can make changes to either the react or blocks lib and build them locally by doing `npm run build:lib` or `npm run build:blocks` respectively.

All contributions are welcome :heart:
